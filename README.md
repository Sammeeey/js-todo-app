# js-todo-app
Basic vanilla JavaScript todo app

My first own implemented JavaScript. - **I always appreciate [feedback!ðŸ¤—](https://github.com/Sammeeey)**

Based on [Dev Ed's YouTube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttf3CEsEwMQ) but not completely the same.

Implemented own approaches after [1:01:36 of the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttf3CEsEwMQ&t=3696s).

## addtitional features (which aren't covered in the tutorial)
- reload todo list from local storage after page refresh
